# MTM4502 Optimization Techniques Task
In this repository, you can find the MATLAB codes to apply five different optimization algorithms, which are:
1) Newton-Raphson
2) Hestenes-Stiefel
3) Polak-Ribi√©re
4) Fletcher-Reeves
5) Gradient Descent (Steepest Descent)
to the Shekel 5 function.

This project is given as a task for MTM4502 Optimization Techniques course.

All algorithms works with three randomly generated initial x vectors, the graphs of the algorithm optimization paths based on:
1) x0 = [3.954450; 4.041713; 3.947645; 4.043338]
2) x0 = [3.950592; 4.064731; 4.045430; 4.014870]
3) x0 = [4.057161; 4.036067; 3.940584; 4.058438]
