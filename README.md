# MTM4502 Optimization Techniques Task
In this repository, you can find the MATLAB codes to apply five different optimization algorithms, which are:
1) Newton-Raphson
2) Hestenes-Stiefel
3) Polak-Ribi√©re
4) Fletcher-Reeves
5) Gradient Descent (Steepest Descent)
to the Shekel 5 function.

This project is given as a task for MTM4502 Optimization Techniques course.
